To calculate **distance**, **time**, and **speed**, there are simple formulas you can use. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### 1. **Speed**  
**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
Where:
- **Speed** is how fast an object is moving.
- **Distance** is the total length traveled by the object.
- **Time** is how long it takes to travel the distance.

### 2. **Distance**  
If you already know the speed and the time, you can find the distance using the formula:  
**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Where:
- **Distance** is the total length traveled.
- **Speed** is how fast the object is moving.
- **Time** is the total time spent traveling.

### 3. **Time**  
If you know the speed and the distance, you can calculate time using this formula:  
**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
Where:
- **Time** is how long it took to travel the distance.
- **Distance** is the total length traveled.
- **Speed** is how fast the object was moving.

### **Example Calculations:**

1. **Finding Speed:**
   - Suppose you traveled **100 meters** in **5 seconds**.
   - **Speed = Distance / Time**
   - **Speed = 100 meters / 5 seconds = 20 meters per second (m/s)**

2. **Finding Distance:**
   - If you are traveling at a speed of **60 km/h** for **2 hours**:
   - **Distance = Speed × Time**
   - **Distance = 60 km/h × 2 hours = 120 km**

3. **Finding Time:**
   - If you travel **150 kilometers** at a speed of **50 km/h**:
   - **Time = Distance / Speed**
   - **Time = 150 km / 50 km/h = 3 hours**

These basic formulas help you solve for the missing value when you know two others.
